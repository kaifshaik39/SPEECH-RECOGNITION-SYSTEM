TASK 1 (EMBEDDED SYSTEMS INTERNSHIP)

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: SHAIK MOHAMMED KAIF

INTERN ID: CITS0D758

DOMAIN: EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

BATCH DURATION: JUNE 17th,2025 to AUGUST 2ND,2025 (6 Weeks)

MENTOR NAME: Neela Santhosh Kumar

## üìñ Project Overview

The **Speech Recognition System** is a smart embedded automation project that recognizes and responds to predefined human voice commands. It enables **hands-free control** of various appliances and devices, making it ideal for:

- Smart Home Automation  
- Assistive Technology for Differently-Abled Individuals  
- Voice-Activated Systems

This project utilizes a **microcontroller** (Arduino Uno or ESP32) and a **voice recognition module** to capture and process voice inputs. Upon recognizing a command, the system triggers an appropriate output, such as turning on an LED or activating a fan.

It introduces core concepts like **real-time audio processing**, **hardware interfacing**, and **Human-Machine Interaction (HMI)**.

## üß∞ Components Used

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Arduino Uno / ESP32** | Acts as the central controller. Use ESP32 for Bluetooth/Wi-Fi capability. |
| **Voice Recognition Module** (Elechouse V3 / ISD1820) | Recognizes and matches pre-trained voice commands. |
| **Microphone Module** | Captures user voice and sends it to the recognition module. |
| **Output Devices** (LED, Fan, Relay) | Respond to voice commands (e.g., ‚ÄúTurn on light‚Äù). |
| **Power Supply** | 5V adapter, USB, or battery to power the system. |
| **Jumper Wires & Breadboard / PCB** | Used to build and connect the circuit. |
| **Optional: Bluetooth Module (HC-05)** | Enables wireless control or mobile app interface. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The user speaks a **predefined command** (e.g., "Turn on light").
2. The **microphone** captures the voice input.
3. The **voice recognition module** processes the input and matches it against stored commands.
4. If matched, a signal is sent to the **microcontroller**.
5. The **microcontroller** executes the corresponding action (e.g., turns on an LED).
